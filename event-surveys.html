				<h2>How to effectively use event surveys</h2>
				<p>
					Make your next event successful start to finish. Here are some tips
					and online event survey examples to help you collect feedback and draw
					meaningful conclusions from the data. Whether you’re planning an
					event, responding to feedback in real time, or hoping to improve based
					on post-event feedback, follow these guidelines for an easy way to
					make surveying an integral part of your success.
				</p>
				<h2>Take the stress out of event planning</h2>
				<p>
					Send a survey to invitees to get an accurate headcount and tailor your
					event according to their preferences. With SurveyMonkey, you can even
					<a href="#">accept payments</a> in your surveys.
				</p>
				<div>
					<p>
						Do you plan fundraisers, conferences, parties, or weddings? Whether
						casual or fancy, business or personal, you know it takes a lot of
						work. There’s the venue to book, speakers or entertainment to
						coordinate, and RSVPs to gather. Surveys make it easy to get the
						information you need—before and after your event—to be sure everyone
						has a great time, and to make each event you plan better than the
						last. You’ll need an accurate headcount to make sure you have enough
						food to go around. Send out a simple RSVP questionnaire to get the
						names, addresses, the number of people, and any other information
						you need to accurately plan your event. You can also use surveys to
						ask about people’s availability if you need help setting a date.

				<h3>Professional events and conferences</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Before you decide on that team building exercise, offsite, or
						holiday party, send out a corporate event questionnaire to gather
						all of the data you need to make an informed decision. Poll
						attendees about things like dietary restrictions and what they hope
						to get out of the event. Use our expert-certified templates, or
						customize questions to be as specific as you like.
					</p>

				</div>
				<h3>Fundraisers and non-profits</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Use surveys to understand everyone’s availability, coordinate
						volunteers, or collect donations. To make sure your donors have a
						great experience, take a little time to understand what makes them
						tick. Did the event do enough to discuss the cause? Or was it fun
						enough? Are they more or less likely to donate? Asking these
						questions can help things run smoothly so you can meet your
						fundraising goals.

				<h2>5 tips for successful event surveys</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="#">After your event</a>, send a survey to see what attendees
					thought of the menu, speakers, and more so you can improve.
				</p>
				<h3>1. Send your <a href="#">post-event survey</a> soon</h3>
				<p>
					As time goes by, the details of an event you held may get a little
					fuzzy. You’ll want to know exactly what your guests liked, what they
					didn’t like, and what they’d like to see next time, so get their
					responses while the event is still fresh in their memory.
				</p>
				<p>
					Better yet, get feedback during the event. Our new app, SurveyMonkey
					Anywhere, helps you collect responses, regardless of your internet
					connection.
				</p>
				<h3>3. Make it anonymous</h3>
				<p>
					Unless you’re asking for contact information, be sure to let your
					guests know their event survey answers are 100% anonymous. In order to
					gain the most insight, you want to be sure that they feel comfortable
					complimenting (and criticizing) the event.
				</p>
				<h3>4. Choose your incentives wisely</h3>
				<p>
					Incentivizing your respondents to give feedback can be a good idea,
					but keep this in mind: If you offer everybody survey rewards,
					attendees may rush through your survey without giving much thought to
					responses. A good way to get quality answers is to offer your
					attendees a way to enter a raffle for a prize or generic gift card
					that would appeal to most of them. Don’t forget to ask for their
					contact information to follow up if they’ve won.
				</p>
				<h3>5. Consider your data in context</h3>
				<p>
					Comparing your event feedback survey data with event data from others
					is a great way to understand your performance. For example, if 67% of
					your attendees say they’d recommend your event to others, how do you
					know whether that’s good or bad? When you use our General Event
					Feedback Survey Template as is, you can see your data in context by
					comparing your survey results against our industry
					<a href="#">benchmarks for attendee satisfaction</a>.
