					<p>
						Likert scale responses for customer service are very flexible and
						can be used to measure a variety of sentiments; from agreement, to
						satisfaction, frequency, and desirability.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, you might be interested in how often customers use your
						online help portal, in which case a frequency response (ie: Never,
						Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Frequently) would be useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below is an example of a customer service Likert scale survey
						question.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our company?
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our company?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="dis open-ended">
					<p>
						Open-ended questions allow customers to share their thoughts and
						opinions for more in-depth insights and new ideas.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, this Market Research Survey Template starts with
						several open-ended questions that ask customers to list specific
						things they like and changes they would like to see:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What do you like most about our new product?</li>
						<li>What changes would most improve our product?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Learn more about open-ended questions></p>
				</div>
				<div class="dis nominal">
					<p>
						Nominal questions are naming scales, which pinpoint different
						categories of questions. These answers cannot be assigned a
						numerical value.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, the answers are not created to be connected in any way,
						unless you add an option for “all of the above.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The answers to nominal questions have no specific order; they are
						meant to carry significance for variable labels only.
					</p>
					<p>An example of a nominal question:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Which brands of shoes from our online store do you prefer?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Explore more customer satisfaction survey questions></p>
				</div>
				<div class="dis binary-scale">
					<p>
						Binary scale questions rely on a limit of two answers per question,
						hence the name “binary.” These can be presented as simple yes or no
						questions,as well as questions that can be answered with graphics
						such as thumbs up/ thumbs down, or with happy face/ sad face emojis.
					</p>
					<p>Here is an example of a Binary scale question:</p>

			<h2>Why is customer satisfaction important?</h2>
			<p>
				Your customers may have already been through a costly acquisition
				process and many are often repeat buyers. Your best customers can become
				evangelists for your brand, and a steady source of ongoing referrals can
				help build your customer base. Customer satisfaction can be a moving
				target. You can’t assume that a customer who was thrilled with your
				product at the time of purchase continues to be satisfied over time.
			</p>
			<p>
				One poor customer service interaction or a wonky product that does not
				deliver on its promise can quickly turn an advocate into a skeptic or
				even a detractor. This can lead to declining customer satisfaction that
				can be a significant drag on your business.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="how-customer">
			<h2>How can customer satisfaction be measured?</h2>
			<p>
				Avoiding the pitfalls of declining customer satisfaction requires
				ongoing measurement that can generate key
				<a href="#">customer satisfaction metrics</a>
				that you can track, analyze and act on. Fortunately, there are proven
				ways to consistently capture what’s going on in the hearts and minds of
				your customers.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a range of options for measuring customer satisfaction, and
				smart companies employ all of them. One method is to monitor indirect
				feedback which involves tracking website traffic and activity, including
				time spent on specific web pages and frequency of shared content.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regularly monitoring social media can also keep your finger on the pulse
				of how customers and others are talking about your products and
				services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet often the most useful measures of customer satisfaction can be
				derived through surveys that offer you the powerful ability to capture
				direct feedback from your current customers.

				<h3>Breaking down scoring in customer satisfaction surveys</h3>
				<p>
					Surveys should be the core of your customer satisfaction program as
					they offer the most relevant and timely insights from your customers
					and generate key customer satisfaction metrics. Customer satisfaction
					surveys can take on many different forms. There are some well
					established customer satisfaction survey methods that companies across
					many industries use to provide a consistent snapshot of satisfaction
					levels.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mid">
				<div>
					<h4>Customer satisfaction score</h4>
					<p>
						The customer satisfaction score targets the customer with variations
						of a basic question:
					</p>
					<p>
						<i
							>“How would you rate your experience interacting with our
							sales/customer service/support department?”
						</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Within this scoring, more positive answers from respondents reflect
						in higher scores. Here’s a typical scale used for CSAT:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Very unsatisfactory</li>
						<li>Unsatisfactory</li>
						<li>Neutral</li>
						<li>Satisfactory</li>
						<li>Very satisfactory</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The scoring derived from CSAT survey questions is designed to alert
						you to evolving consumer trends, behaviors, and attitudes that may
						influence how your current customers view your company, products,
						and services.
					</p>
					<h3>Leverage social proof for marketing</h3>
					<p>
						Customer satisfaction scoring can help you back up marketing claims
						with data. TechValidate by SurveyMonkey helps you gather data from
						your customers that you can use directly in case studies, customer
						testimonials, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Create a better customer experienceBuild customer satisfaction
						scoring into a customer experience (CX) program. GetFeedback, also
						by the maker of SurveyMonkey, can help you launch your program.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Net Promoter Score</h4>
					<p>
						Net Promoter Score provides a quick and reliable measurement of
						customer satisfaction by asking respondents to rate their
						willingness to recommend your products or services. As such, it
						poses this straightforward question:
					</p>
					<p>
						<i
							>“On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our
							product/service to a friend?”</i
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						This organizes respondents into three groups rated from 0 (not at
						all likely) to 10 (extremely likely).
					</p>
					<p>
						Depending on the responses, customers fall into one of 3 categories:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Promoters-</b>Customers who respond with a score of 9 or 10.
							Typically, these customers are loyal and enthusiastic customers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Passives - </b>Customers who respond with a score of 7 or 8.
							These customers are satisfied with your service but not happy
							enough to be considered promoters.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Calculate your NPS by subtracting the percentage of detractors from
						that of promoters. The higher your score, the better.

            <h2>How to use customer satisfaction surveys</h2>
            <p>What should be in your customer satisfaction questionnaire, and how can you get it in front of customers? This all depends on your goals and what exactly you’re trying to find out or improve. Here are a few common ways businesses use customer satisfaction surveys.</p>
            <h3>Determine product or service performance</h3>
            <p>Survey clients who haven’t used your services for months to identify what went wrong, and what you can do to win them back. A customer feedback survey can be a good tool to get outside feedback on employee performance and how each person’s role is tied to client satisfaction.</p>
            <h3>Collect product feedback</h3>
            <p>Creating online survey questionnaires to send to customers who’ve just made a purchase is an effective way to collect product feedback because you are capturing their first reactions to your products. Did that new and revolutionary tent fabric weather the elements? The results could reveal valuable insights on how to improve product features or address design flaws.</p>
            <h3>Develop new products</h3>
            <p>Identify opportunities for new products by using a customer satisfaction survey to see what expectations aren’t met by existing choices.</p>
            <h3>Measure customer loyalty</h3>
            <p>Surveys can help you discover your most loyal customers and influencers. Brand champions, power users, brand loyalists, brand heroes. No matter what you call them, they’re your answer to knowing exactly what you’re doing right, what to keep doing, and what to start doing. Showing customers that you’re listening goes a long way.</p>
            <h3>Improve the customer experience</h3>
            <p>Customer satisfaction surveys are a great tool to drive regular communication between you and your customers. They can act as a reminder that you’re there—and that you value their business. Poll them on how they’re doing, what suggestions they might have, and consider offering loyal customers swag or rewards for answering your surveys.</p>
            <h3>Conduct market research surveys</h3>
            <p>Want to grow a new service area? Need to make sure your marketing is addressing the right consumer niche? Get to know potential markets by first sending out an online market research survey to find out more about demographics, such as age, gender, income, hobbies, etc. </p>
            <h3>Establish performance goals</h3>
            <p>Now that you’ve got all of this great actionable data, you need to make sure feedback is implemented. Use customer feedback surveys to reach back out to customers and measure your progress over regular periods of time. Leverage what you’ve learned from this valuable data to rake in revenue and improve customer and employee satisfaction and loyalty. Compare results over time to see how you’ve improved.</p>
            <h3>Management reporting</h3>
            <p>Data from customer satisfaction questionnaires can also help with management reporting. Managers can identify key drivers and metrics they should track across departments and roles.</p>
            <h3>Keep your employees engaged</h3>
            <p>When you offer excellent customer service, you’re much more likely to find and retain customers. Make employee engagement a priority to improve customer satisfaction and your level of customer service. Regularly checking in with employees to see what makes them tick and creating performance benchmarks can go a long way toward keeping your customers happy.</p>
            <h2>Benefits of customer satisfaction surveys</h2>
            <p>Customer satisfaction surveys give you the insights you need to make better decisions. In fact, we’ve found that businesses who measure customer satisfaction are 33% more likely to describe themselves as successful than those who don’t.</p>
            <p>A consumer survey will help you understand your customers’ likes, dislikes, and where you need to make improvements. For example, what does the average customer think about your prices? Too high? Just right? How well is your staff doing on customer service, or how well does your client success team understand the growing needs of your customers—and prospects? Is there anything at all about the customer experience that turns off your customers? You might even poll clients on why they stop doing business with you, how you might win them back, and how you can prevent customer losses in the future.</p>
            <p>Empower your employees to meet milestones based on client needs. And, if you’re developing a new product or updating an existing one, customers can provide you with invaluable feedback about design and functionality. Oftentimes, customers will show you problems that would have otherwise been missed.</p>
            <h2>How to create effective customer surveys</h2>
            <p>In addition to using methodologically-sound questions in the key areas already mentioned, you’ll also want to follow these tips for creating a great consumer survey.</p>
            <h3>1. Aim for clarity</h3>
            <p>Say you’re surveying customer satisfaction for a hotel stay. Don’t make your respondents guess what you mean by asking generally about different aspects of their stay. Tell them what the standard should be. Ask if the room service was prompt, if the swimming pool was clean, if the check-in clerk was friendly, if their bed was comfortable, and so on.</p>
            <h3>2. Be specific</h3>
            <p>Don’t ask questions about broad concepts or ideas; ask about specific concepts or ideas (i.e. being “a good person” is general; being “polite to waiters” is specific). Specific questions and answers will make it easier to identify things to improve.</p>
            <h3>3. Ask more than one specific question</h3>
            <p>Asking multiple specific questions instead of one general question will not only make your questions easier to answer for your respondents, but it will also make your data easier to analyze and act on. Did your waiter let you know about the specials of the day? Did he take your order promptly? Was he able to answer all of your questions? Was he able to coordinate the timing of your courses? Just be careful not to ask too many questions. We’ve seen consumers’ response rates go down when answering surveys becomes a burden.</p>
            <h3>4. Keep survey length short</h3>
            <p>When it comes to the length of your survey it’s important to find the right balance. Too short, and you won’t get enough insights to be useful. But go too long, and you run the risk of overwhelming respondents that presents the risk of lower participation or some respondents bailing out midway through the survey. Put yourself in the respondents shoes, and consider what would be a reasonable amount of questions that you would answer. You can also get feedback from colleagues on survey length.</p>
            <h3>5. Avoid leading & loaded questions </h3>
            <p>Asking biased questions can be a survey killer, potentially turning off respondents and skewing results. Two common sources of biased survey questions are loaded and leading questions. Each sways respondents to answer in ways that don’t account for their true feelings and preferences.</p>
