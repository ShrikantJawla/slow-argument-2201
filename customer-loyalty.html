					<h2>How to use customer loyalty surveys</h2>
					<p>
						When you understand shoppers’ interests, goals, and pet peeves, you
						can adjust and refine your inventory and service to keep them coming
						back for more. Here’s how.
					</p>
					<h3>Repeat business</h3>
					<p>
						Ask your customers if they would do business with you again. It
						might be nerve-wracking to hear about a client who may never come
						back, but it’s information you absolutely must have. Is it your
						great service? The customer loyalty card? Habit? Not only does it
						give you an opportunity to correct the issue, but it helps you solve
						the problem for future shoppers.
					</p>
					<h3>Referral business</h3>
					<p>
						Consumer loyalty statistics show referrals are one of the top ways
						to get new business. If a customer is delighted, they’ll talk about
						it with their friends, family, and social networks. If a client is
						merely satisfied, they may not. Get your company to the enviable
						position of enjoying word-of-mouth referrals when you conduct a
						customer satisfaction survey. Many businesses use a Net Promoter
						Score survey to discover if their customers are apt to refer them to
						their friends Learn about how to earn consumer trust and started
						getting new referrals. You can also discover if they’ve already made
						referrals, and if so, what encouraged them to do so.
					</p>
					<h3>Learn about what they like</h3>
					<p>
						Getting <a href="#">customer feedback</a> is a great way to pinpoint
						why consumers return. Ask some of your best customers to answer
						questions about their <a href="#">brand</a> loyalty and you may be
						surprised by the results. For instance, you might be extremely proud
						of your apple pie, but it’s actually the coffee that gets people in
						your <a href="#">restaurant’s</a> doors.
					</p>
					<h3>Even better, learn about what they don’t like</h3>
					<p>
						Thicken that skin and invite criticism with a questionnaire on
						consumer loyalty that expects brutal honesty. From the color of the
						walls to the music you’re playing, little things add up to the total
						experience. If you have an appropriate audience, you might even
						think about making this kind of customer survey a little
						tongue-in-cheek. For example, invite customers to “let us have it,”
						and provide fun, humorous response options.
					</p>

					<h2>4 tips for great customer loyalty surveys</h2>
					<h3>1. Use closed-ended questions</h3>
					<p>
						Start with simple “yes” or “no” options, then use skip logic to
						focus responses on the product, customer service, or website
						usability.
					</p>
					<h3>2. Don’t try to ask too much in a single question</h3>
					<p>
						Questions such as, “Did our product arrive on time and in good
						condition?” There could easily be two completely different responses
						for each part of the questions.
					</p>
					<h3>3. Get creative</h3>
					<p>
						Ask questions about what makes your organization different from
						competitors, such as ambiance, personality, or a unique product.
						There might be something special about your company that you can
						capitalize on in advertisements or on your website.
					</p>
					<h3>4. Ask about consumer loyalty programs</h3>
					<p>
						Is a customer loyalty program something your shoppers want? Do
						people actually use those punch cards? Does it take too long to earn
						a reward? Is it the only reason customers are returning to your
						store? The answers to these questions will help you set up or
						improve a loyalty program.
